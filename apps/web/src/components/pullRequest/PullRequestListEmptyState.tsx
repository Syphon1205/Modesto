 *
 * An empty page and an unread one look the same, so the states that are showing a host's answer
 * offer to ask for it again. The two that are not — a search still in flight, and a workspace
 * with no project to read from — leave the button out, since pressing it could only repeat what
 * is already happening or ask nobody.
